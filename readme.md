# Introduction

This repository houses my personal website.  Feel free to fork and play around.  It's originally based on the Ziet Hyper theme.

## CI/CD

Everything here automatically deploys integrates and deploys through the CI environment that I built.  Unfortunately, it requires quite a few steps and I will outline them here but just realize it's not _all_ plug and play.

I use a number of other OSS tools that I've built to run this website.
